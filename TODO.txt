Still ToDo
 * Remove Hit Points and replace with Stress and Trauma tracks (make it so we can switch back and forth between hit points and trauma track)
 * Complications should be makable as "Permanent", so that non-permanent ones (like "tied up") can be quickly removed at the end of a scene
 * Add Classes back as Item types, move Subclasses to the top with Classes
 * Add Virtues and Vices at least to the NPC sheet, though maybe also to the PC sheet under "Relationships"? Or change that tab to "Social"?
 * Add Motives and Goals to the PC and NPC sheets
 * Make Milestones checkable on the main list sheet
 * Make it so that Milestones can add XP to the character's XP pool, but when they do so they become "locked"
 * Make it so that only reusable Milestones can be unlocked
 * Make it so that we can roll initiative (port my fix from the other cortex system)


 * Make it so Abilities and Spells can require Energy and/or Magic Points (from 0 to 5 of each maybe?)

 * Finish the Monster's character sheet

 * Finish the NPC's character sheet
    + refactor it a bit to use parts of the player character sheet

 * Add the important sub-types of NPCs and Monsters:
   + Add Bosses which have more hit points or "life dice"
   + Add Mobs which are similar as they have more Life Dice, but weaken as they lose hit points or life dice, instead of strengthening

 * Make it so that armor dice degrade and can be repaired
 * Make it so if an ability or spell has a cost, it doesn't "spend" it, but instead adds it to the pool

 * Make it so that the dice pool can contain Energy and Magic Points

 * Create a macro/tool to roll difficulty for the GM automatically (or add them to a pool, at least)


<-- Playable by here -->


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Nice to have

 * WORKFLOWS:
 * Make it so that if a character is targeting another character, they can click a button on the pool which will add any complications, injuries or other stuff to their dice pool
 * Make it so a character can add an existing roll to their hotbar
 * Make it so GM can easily roll difficulties
 * Make it so GM can easily add complications
 * Make it so GM can easily add Stress/Injuries
 * Make it so GM can easily grant PP/MP to a character
 * Make it so potions/lacrima/magic/abilities can heal conditions or health/stress/injuries
 * Make it so there is a GM Bank / Doom Pool / etc for the GM's MP to come from
 * Make it so a player can click a chat message button and add that message's Difficulty or VS role to roll against
 * Make it so this versus roll can check for Heroic Successes
 * Make it so this versus roll/check will add Heroic Successes to the player that rolled them
 * Make it so if a player fails a versus check of only 1 exchange, they can click a chat button to "bow out gracefully" and gain a PP/MP
 * Make it so that a player can easily mark a milestone as "Complete" and gain the XP for it
   + Should it send a request to the GM to approve before granting it?
 * Make it so you can drag and drop characters onto each other, which forms a relationship object
 * Make it so that Bosses alert the GM when they reach different levels of health (so that new abilities can trigger)



 * Make it so there are "Resource Dice", which are consumed when rolled, but can be reset
