 * Add Motives and Goals to the PC and NPC sheets *CHECK*
 * Complications should be makable as "Permanent", so that non-permanent ones (like "tied up") can be quickly removed at the end of a scene *CHECK*
 * Add Classes back as Item types, move Subclasses to the top with Classes *CHECK*
 * Finish the NPC's character sheet *CHECK*
    + refactor it a bit to use parts of the player character sheet *CHECK*
 * Finish the Monster's character sheet
 * Add the important sub-types of Monsters:
   + Minions & Elites
   + Add Bosses which have more hit points or "life dice"
   + Add Mobs which are similar as they have more Life Dice, but weaken as they lose hit points or life dice, instead of strengthening
 * Make it so that we can roll initiative (port my fix from the other cortex system)
 * Add an AC die to all characters as a main resource (top of sheet) this can be multiple dice
 * Make it so Abilities and Spells can require Energy and/or Magic Points (from 0 to 5 of each maybe?)
 * Make it so that Monsters have elemental Reistances, Immunities and Weaknesses
 * Change the Item templates to use the Dice Selector instead of a text field
 * Make Milestones checkable on the main list sheet
 * Make it so that Milestones can add XP to the character's XP pool, but when they do so they become "locked"
 * Make it so that Milestones can be unlocked by a GM
 * Make it so if an ability or spell has a cost, and the user clicks the "use" button, that resource doesn't get "spent" it, but instead the system adds it to the pool
 * Make it so that if an ability or spell has a cost that you can't pay, it returns an error message and does not add it to the pool
 * Make it so that the dice pool can contain Energy and Magic Points
 * Make it so that if the user clicks "Confirm" on a dice pool that has Magic or Energy in it, those are deducted from the character's sheet
 * Make it so that if the pool has Energy or MP in it, but the character has insufficient MP or Energy, an error is displayed and the pool is not confirmed
 * Make it so that there is a way to remove abilities that require MP or Energy from the pool
 * Add a "Use" button on every Spell and Ability (remove Roll button, but add the dice to the pool if it has any).
 * Make it optionally on any Wondrous Item that has a Magic or Energy cost
 * Change dice colors to Blue instead of blood red
 * Make it so that if a player confirms a dice pool that has a Hindrance die in it, that player's character gains 1 MP automatically
 * Make it so you can name your dice pool
 * Create a "DicePool" item type for the character to store these saved pools
 * Make it so you can drag the Dice Pool into your hotbar, you can't, but you can create an item and drag that to the hotbar
 * Fix spell actor_id for dicepool
 * Make buttons on save dicepool work better
   + Make it so that the button disapears if you have an itemid
   + Make it so that loading a pool from chat (that was added from an item) saves the itemid
   + Make it so that adding or removing a trait from the pool removes the itemid
 * Try to fix bug where you can't save a dicepool object if you only remove a die from it (adding and changing the name seem to work fine). Probably would work if I added a timestamp, I have a feeling it's only doing a shallow compare of the underlying item objects, so it thinks that nothing has changed.
 * What if I had a DicePool type, and if it's set to "normal", we roll normally, if it's set to "Damage" we roll damage and "healing" rolls healing?  Except that there's no functional difference between damage and healing rolls, just what to do with the results of the roll
 * For now, let's just add a "roll all" button
 * Give lots of things damage dice and healing dice
 * Make it so that there's a way to roll just Damage Dice or Healing Dice together without the "selection" process and without worrying about hitches and adding the total together.
 * Make it so that things with charges have their charge deducted as part of the rolling process
   + Items have charges, so Potion, Lacrima, Equipment and Trinket
 * Create a tool to reset a user's Dice Pool in case it breaks
 * Change the icon for charges in the dice pool

Nice to have

Heroic Die mod  needs this:
 * Make it so there are "Resource Dice", which are consumed when rolled, but can be reset


WORKFLOWS:
 * Make it so that if a character is targeting another character, they can click a button on the pool which will add any complications, injuries or other stuff to their dice pool
 * Make it so a character can add an existing roll to their hotbar
 * Make it so GM can easily roll difficulties
 * Make it so GM can easily add complications
 * Make it so GM can easily add Stress/Injuries
 * Make it so GM can easily grant PP/MP to a character
 * Make it so potions/lacrima/magic/abilities can heal conditions or health/stress/injuries
 * Make it so there is a GM Bank / Doom Pool / etc for the GM's MP to come from
 * Make it so a player can click a chat message button and add that message's Difficulty or VS role to roll against
 * Make it so this versus roll can check for Heroic Successes
 * Make it so this versus roll/check will add Heroic Successes to the player that rolled them
 * Make it so if a player fails a versus check of only 1 exchange, they can click a chat button to "bow out gracefully" and gain a PP/MP
 * Make it so that a player can easily mark a milestone as "Complete" and gain the XP for it
   + Should it send a request to the GM to approve before granting it?
 * Make it so you can drag and drop characters onto each other, which forms a relationship object
 * Make it so that Bosses alert the GM when they reach different levels of health (so that new abilities can trigger)

 * Make it so that armor dice degrade and can be repaired


 * Make it so that "Combat Reflexes" adds +1 to a character's initiative for each level they have

 * Remove Hit Points and replace with Stress and Trauma tracks (make it so we can switch back and forth between hit points and trauma track)
